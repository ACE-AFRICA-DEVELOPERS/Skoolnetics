** Testing of this app will take us ta least one week, because we have to explore
   posibilities of a school. So I propose that if we start today, we should be
   done with the testing on or before the 5th of February

What is The reason why I want us to take a week to test it?
1. I want us to populate our database with data. That is, we will be testing not
   just for one school, but for two or more schools. And each school will have
   more than a class, mor than one session(two or more), and three terms each

2. And each term will be run like  a normal school. I want u to see if our app 
   will not conflict with data. As I am typing now, it just occured to me that 
   we always set a closing date for our seesion, right??
   But we can close the session before the closing date, which should not be
   happening, LOOOOOOL, That will be a later fix tho!!!. But we have to test the 
   opening and cloing to see how effective it is 

What are the Possibilities that can happen in a school?
There are different possibilities that can happen in a school within a year and 
they are as follows;
1. A teacher can teach a class more than one subject and still have other classes
   he/she teaches. That is, a teacher can teach JSS1 Intro-tech and Basic Science
   and also be teaching SSS1 - SSS3 Physics. Lesson notes, assignments, tests and 
   exams will be different for all classes nd students. We need to test how effec-
   tive this is 
2. A principal, administrator, can also be a teacher of a class or classes. So 
   after assigning a role, a new data must be created IF you decide you want that 
   particular role taker to teach
3. A parentcan have achild in this school this session/term, and in the next
   session/term decide to bring another child to the school. That is every term,
   we will nee to poppulate each class we have in our school with new staff, new
   student and new parent. Try to pair a new student with an old parent!!!

But in all, we nee an extensive testing of the whole app individually. Your reviews
are welcome. 

HAPPY TESTING GUYS!!!!!
